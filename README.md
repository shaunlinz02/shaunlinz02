## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a quantitative researcher specializing in volatility modeling, machine learning, and numerical methods in quantitative finance.

Here are a list of published papers:

[The quintic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for joint SPX and VIX calibration (Risk Magazine, 2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4308677)

[Joint SPX-VIX calibration with Gaussian polynomial volatility models: deep pricing with quantization hints](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4292544)

[Volatility models in practice: Rough, Path-dependent or Markovian?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4684016)

[Fourier-Laplace Transforms in Polynomial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Volatility Models](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4816314)
